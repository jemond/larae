    <h2>Engagement Video</h2>
    <p>
      Our engagement was a dream come true. It happened amongst the green, lush countryside of southwest Ireland, in a place called the Gap of Dunloe.  In a record setting heat wave, alongside the sheep and rolling hills and on Larae's birthday, I dropped to one knee and asked her to be my wife. She said yes, and we have never looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a video (it's a long one) of our time in Ireland, including the proposal. The proposal section starts around 8:20 with a good view of the Gap of Dunloe. Enjoy! ~ Stephen
